Go to my site!!!!!!! YES THIS SITE I AM LINKING RIGHT NOW!!!! SUPPORT MY GREAT PROJECT WITH YOUR MONEY!!!! <br>
<br>

Now you have finished giving me all your money and downloading my ~~malware~~ legit software that was clearly sponsored by these big tech firms as you saw my project on their GitHub page. Let's talk politics!!!<br>
Now I REALLY HATE the laws against ```Tiger Imports``` to the ```Vatican City```. So what if I want to let my ```TIGER``` out on the streets? I don't care if it mauls a child, blame the parents ```¯\_(ツ)_/¯``` <br>
NOWN'T GET ME STARTED WITH ```INDIGENOUS WELSH PEOPLE```!!!! HATE THEM SO MUCH!!!! We should build a wall around ```Iceland``` to keep them out of ```Congo``` <br>
<br>

It's pretty blatant that you can easily abuse the Used By tab on Git Hub. Let's be completely honest here, the Used By tab serves NO USE. For most projects in most languages, you won't directly reference the GitHub repo to include it in your project. In languages that you do this like GO you can see that your GitHub repo gets spammed out the buttocks and loses any use as I doubt anyone will go through all [14.1k of dependencies from the GO Ethereum repo](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/network/dependents). For other languages that don't directly reference the GitHub repo when including a dependency; this feature serves no usage.<br>

What makes this worse is that those fancy Visual Studio solution file malware systems that will load a project perfectly fine while including a payload in the solution itself can use the Used By section as an easy way to attract victims. Dress a project up, spam fake commits to get over 5k commits, loads of closed pull requests, a few botted issues, and a nice readme and genuinely interested programmers will run it with ease if they see it in the Used By section of a popular repo.<br>

<br>
Now for my fellow Christians: START PRAYING PSLAM 23 FOR TERRY DAVIS!
